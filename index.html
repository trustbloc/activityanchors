        Activity Anchors are based on a federated and replicated
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verifiable-data-registry">Verifiable Data Registry</a> (VDR).
        The decentralized network consists of Activity Anchor Servers that write, monitor, witness, and propagate batches of document operations.
        The batches form a graph that is propagated and replicated between the servers as content-addressable objects.
        These content-addressable objects can be located via both domain and distributed hash table (DHT) mechanisms.
        Each Activity Anchor witness server observes a subset of batches in the graph and includes them in their ledgers (as append-only Merkle Tree logs).
        The servers coordinate by propagating batches of document operations and by monitoring the applicable witness servers' ledgers.
        The Activity Anchor servers form a decentralized network without reliance on a common blockchain for coordination.
      </p>

      <p>
        This document specifies a data model and rules for representing a graph of batches, 
        the anchor server API,
        an [[[ACTIVITYSTREAMS-CORE]]] vocabulary and an [[[ACTIVITYPUB]]] profile for propagating batches,
        and a [[[RFC7033]]] profile for discovering endpoints.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          Our motivation for Activity Anchors is to enable many independent organizations to create <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verifiable-data-registry">
          Verifiable Data Registries</a> (VDRs) that can become connected over time.
          In designing Activity Anchors, we have the goal to enable these VDRs to interconnect into a decentralized network without the need to choose a common public
          blockchain or to rely on special-purpose consortiums to form (and remain in operation).
          Activity Anchors enables a federated, replicated and scalable VDR based on a decentralized network for propagating, witnessing and replicating changes to documents.

        <p>
          An Activity Anchor Server exposes APIs for propagation, content-addressable storage, discovery, and witnessing.

            <h4>AnchorEvent</h4>

            <p>
              An operation batch is represented as an <i>AnchorEvent</i>.
              Hashlinks [[HASHLINK]] are used to link objects to the AnchorEvent.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hashlinks may refer to the <i>contentObject</i> within an <i>AnchorObject</i>.
              Prior to creating the hash in the Hashlink, the contents of the <i>contentObject</i> MUST be canoncialized using the JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS) [[RFC8785]].
              The Hashlink refers to the canonicalized contents of the <i>contentObject</i>.

            <p>
              Activity Anchor Servers use ActivityPub <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#delivery">Delivery</a> mechanisms to propagate anchor activitys and to request to follow other servers.
              A propagation or follow request is sent by performing an HTTP POST of an activity to an Activity Anchor Server's ActivityPub inbox endpoint.
            </p>

            <p>
              Activity Anchor Servers use HTTP Signatures [[HTTP-SIGNATURES]] when calling Server-to-Server APIs to create authenticated messages.
              The anchor objects are additionally signed using JSON-LD proofs [[LDPROOF]] from both the Writer server as well as Witness servers.

              An Activity Anchor Server MAY notify other actors that it has successfully processed an anchor event using the <i>Like</i> activity.
              In particular, it is useful for the originator of the anchor to discover other actors that are processing the events it is producing.
              Processing an anchor event MAY also result in the creation of an additional reference to the anchor event due to replication.
              The <i>result</i> property MAY be included to allow other actors to discover the additional anchor reference.
              Note: the new anchor reference MAY contain multiple links to the anchor event (representing multiple replication sources).

          <p>
            WebFinger [[RFC7033]] is used to discover endpoints for anchor service and resource URIs.
          </p>

          <p>The following example retrieves endpoints for a service named anchor at alice.example.com.</p>

            Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
          </pre>

          <p>
            When the resource exists, an HTTP 200 status code is returned.

            Aliases for a resource can also be queried. For example, the following is a request for anchor@alice.example.com.
            This request has the same response as the prior example.
